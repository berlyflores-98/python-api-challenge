Part 1 - Weather API Observations

We got to observe the relationship of Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed across all different latitudes. What this analyzation wanted to prove was that the closer you got to the equator (characterized by latitude 0) the higher the temperature was. We were able to prove this by doing a linear regression test and r-squared measure that prove that the two are highly related. The closer or lower the latitude was, the higher Max Temp was. Additionally, we took a closer look into Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind speed. These other measures are not correlated to the latitude. Humidity is equal across all latitudes, although it might not feel like it in Texas.
